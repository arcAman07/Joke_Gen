## Research Methodology

### Experimental Design

#### 1. **Progressive Complexity Approach**
Each implementation builds upon the previous, allowing for clear attribution of performance improvements to specific techniques.

#### 2. **Standardized Evaluation Protocol**
- Same topics across all systems
- Consistent joke count (5 per evaluation)
- Identical LLM judge prompts
- Statistical significance testing

#### 3. **Multi-Dimensional Assessment**
- **Humor Quality**: Primary objective measure
- **Novelty**: Creativity vs. memorization detection
- **Diversity**: Within-set variation measurement
- **Efficiency**: Generation time and computational cost

### Key Metrics

#### Humor Score (0-1)
- LLM-judged quality assessment
- Considers timing, wordplay, and impact
- Temperature-controlled for consistency

#### Novelty Score (0-1)
Combined metric incorporating:
- Pattern penalty: `pattern_score × semantic_novelty`
- Semantic similarity: Cosine distance from existing jokes
- Structural analysis: Setup-punchline pattern recognition
- Edit distance: Character-level uniqueness

#### Diversity Score (0-1)
- Variance across humor dimensions
- Normalized by dimension count
- Calculated as: `1 - exp(-variance/10)`

#### Weighted Final Score
`0.6 × humor + 0.3 × diversity + 0.1 × novelty`

*Weights empirically optimized through grid search*

### Bias Mitigation Strategies

#### LLM-as-a-Judge Bias Reduction
1. **Explicit criteria**: Detailed evaluation prompts
2. **Temperature control**: Consistent 0.1 for evaluation
3. **Cache-based consistency**: Identical inputs produce identical outputs
4. **Multiple evaluation rounds**: Reduces random variation

#### Position Bias Handling
- Randomized presentation order
- Blind evaluation (no system identification)
- A/B comparison rather than absolute scoring
